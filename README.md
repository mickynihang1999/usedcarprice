## Introduction
• This project is about Used Car Price Prediction, In this project i will take some input from user and my machine learning model will predict selling price of vehicle.

### Tools and Technologies
• In this project i used cardekho.com dataset from kaggle.com, I had trained a **Machine Learning** model and i got **95.92%** accuracy using Random Forest Regressor.


• This repository consists of files required to deploy a ___Machine Learning Web App___ created with ___Flask___ on ___Heroku___ platform.

• If you want to view the deployed model, click on the following link:<br />
